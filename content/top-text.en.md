From the first days of the war in Ukraine we have been helping both in the territory of Ukraine and in Poland. We manage to reach effectively people and groups particularly affected by the humanitarian crisis and the war. In our activities we use the experience of a social organisation as well as our  involvement  in organising humanitarian and development aid in different regions of the world.
