From the first days of the war in Ukraine we have been helping both in the territory of Ukraine and in Poland. We have managed to effectively reach people and groups particularly affected by the humanitarian crisis and the war. In our activities we build on our experience as a social organisation as well as on learnings from our involvement in organising humanitarian and development aid in different regions of the world.
