### What we do:

Today, after more than 1.5 years of this constant wartime effort, we are refocusing our projects to channel resources and funding into sustainable and validated initiatives that focus on children and youth and will help strengthen the civic society in both Ukraine and Poland.  

- Education: running a Ukrainian school in Warsaw for 270 children and providing workshops for teachers.
- “Mountains of Leadership”: Training Ukrainian and Polish students and future leaders to get involved in youth animation and project management.
- Integration: Running summer and winter camps to build relationships between children and youth from Poland and Ukraine.
- “Play for peace”: Running a project for high-school youth aimed at training peaceful approach to resolving conflicts, animated by alumni of “Mountains of Leadership”. 
- Respite: organizing respite camps for children of Ukrainian soldiers who have fallen at war.
